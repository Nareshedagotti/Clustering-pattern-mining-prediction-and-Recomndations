## Clustering, Linear Regression Prediction, and Recommendation

### Overview

This repository contains the code and results for three distinct data analysis tasks:

1. **Clustering**: We implemented K-Means Clustering to group data points into clusters based on their similarity. This method helps in segmenting our data effectively, enabling us to draw meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions.

2. **Linear Regression Prediction**: In this task, we developed a Linear Regression model to predict an output variable based on input features. By providing relevant input data, our model can forecast future values, which is valuable for various predictive analytics applications.

3. **Recommendation**: Using customer data, we built a recommendation system to suggest products or services tailored to individual customers. By inputting a customer ID, our system generates recommendations based on their historical preferences and behaviors.

### Repository Structure

- **Clustering**: Contains code and documentation related to the K-Means Clustering project. You can explore how we grouped similar data points into clusters and the insights gained from this segmentation.

- **Linear_Regression_Prediction**: Here, you'll find code and documentation for our Linear Regression Prediction model. By providing input data, you can predict future outcomes and understand the factors influencing them.

- **Recommendation_System**: This section covers our recommendation system project. Input a customer ID, and the system will suggest products or services based on that customer's history.

### Getting Started

To explore these projects and run the code:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific project directory you're interested in (e.g., Clustering, Linear_Regression_Prediction, or Recommendation_System).
3. Follow the instructions in the project's README file to set up the environment and execute the code.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on similar data analysis projects. We're excited to share our insights and expertise with the data community!
